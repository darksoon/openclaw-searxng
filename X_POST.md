🚨 BRAVE API DEAD? 🚨

OpenClaw Users: Tired of paying $10+/month for web search?

I just killed my Brave API bill and replaced it with SELF-HOSTED SearXNG.

Results:
✅ $0/month
✅ Unlimited searches  
✅ 70+ search engines (Google, DDG, Brave, Bing...)
✅ 100% privacy - your queries stay local
✅ 5 minute setup

How it works:
1. 🐳 Run SearXNG in Docker (free)
2. 🔧 Enable JSON API (one command)
3. 🤖 Point OpenClaw to it (config change)
4. 💰 Save $120+/year

Before → After:
❌ Brave API: $10/month, rate limited, privacy concerns
✅ SearXNG: $0/month, unlimited, self-hosted, private

Performance test:
"Flutter Android Auto 2025"
- Brave API: 10 results, $0.001/search
- SearXNG: 27 results, $0.000/search

The kicker? "Brave" in your config now means SearXNG SCRAPES Brave Search for free. Not the paid API.
